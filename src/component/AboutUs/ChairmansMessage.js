                Plastics have changed the world around us in ways more that we
                can account for, and in the days ahead the role of plastics will
                not diminish. On the contrary we will see increase use of
                plastics in novel applications. We at RAKtherm understand our
                responsibilities and are prepared to meet the challenges and
                demands of the future through breakthrough concepts and

                I strongly believe that all the members of the RAKtherm will
                soon position themselves as the best in their respective niches
                and expand their reach over a wide geographical area. It gives
                me immense pleasure to say that today we are among the best
                companies in plastic converting industries, and as the chairman
                it is a matter of great pride for me which I intend to uphold by
                committing to be consistent in our products and services.
